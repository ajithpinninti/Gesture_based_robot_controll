# Gesture_based_robot_controll
We've implemented gesture based bot control with arduino micrcontroller and python based finger detection. Python programee will access webcame of the computer and capture video. It'll process the video and detect number of fingers in the video. Based on the finger number it'll send signal to arduino usign bluetooth serial communication. Bot will react based on the signals from pc with arduino micrcontroller.
